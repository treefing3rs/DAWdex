# 05 — Memory & module composition

How the engine wasm and device wasm modules share memory and call each other. **This gates the whole
plugin architecture — spike it before committing (see end).**

## How wasm modules compose (the literal answer)

- **Wasm doesn't load wasm.** The **host (JS, in the worklet)** instantiates each module
  (`WebAssembly.instantiate`) — async, at **setup, off the audio thread**.
- **Not parallel — called sequentially.** Single-threaded (decided). The engine's loop calls each
  device's `process`.
- **Shared memory:** create **one `WebAssembly.Memory`** and pass it as an **import** to the engine
  *and* every device → they all read/write the **same linear memory**. Share a **`WebAssembly.Table`**
  too; the engine calls devices via **`call_indirect` through the table → wasm-to-wasm, no JS in the
  hot path** after setup.
- **"Same layout" = the ABI.** The shared `Memory` is the raw substrate; the ABI is the agreed
  convention over it (buffer/param locations, function signatures).

## The hard part: heap / allocator ownership

Two independently-compiled Rust modules sharing **one** linear memory each assume they own the heap
→ **allocator corruption**. This is the real difficulty, not the loading. Options:

- **A. One shared memory, engine-assigned arenas.** Devices don't use a free heap in shared memory;
  the engine hands each an arena (bump allocator within it). Zero-copy, no JS in loop. **Fastest,
  most restrictive** on device code (`no_std`-ish / custom allocator).
- **B. Per-device private memory + small shared I/O memory.** Needs the **multi-memory** feature
  (recent browsers only — verify). Device keeps its own heap; audio/params pass through a shared I/O
  memory both import. Clean isolation + zero-copy I/O.
- **C. Per-device memory + host copies the block in/out.** Simplest, fully isolated. Data is tiny
  (~1 KB/block/device) so bandwidth is a non-issue; the cost is **per-device JS call overhead** in the
  loop. Probably fine — must measure.

**Lean: A** (no multi-memory dependency, best perf), ABI passes buffer offsets; keep **C** as the
guaranteed-works fallback.

## Reclaiming allocator (done: talc)

The `engine` crate uses **talc** (`talc::wasm::WasmDynamicTalc` via `new_wasm_dynamic_allocator()`) as
its global allocator: it reclaims freed blocks and grows linear memory via `memory.grow` on demand
(no fixed arena). It replaced an earlier test-grade bump allocator that never freed. Cost: +4% wasm
size (~3.7 KB), deps `talc` + `lock_api`; single-threaded build, so no spinlock. Under host
`cargo test` it is cfg'd out and std's allocator is used, so workspace tests are unaffected.

The cleanup logic was already correct (Rust `Drop` calls `dealloc` for removed boxes, rebuilt edges,
and unsubscribed observers, proven by the subscription test), so the swap reclaims that memory with
no drop-logic changes.

**Invariant:** never allocate or grow on the audio thread during `render`. talc grows via
`memory.grow`, which can detach `memory.buffer`, so JS must re-read the buffer after any growth (the
worklet already re-fetches it each `process()`). This unblocks **sample buffers** (large, dynamic),
which could not free under the bump.

## Other memory concerns

- **No growth in the hot path:** pre-size/pre-grow memory; arena allocators; refresh JS views if it
  ever grows.
- Read-only **box graph** lives in (shared) memory, read by the engine.
- Audio buffers, param blocks, telemetry, event queues = fixed layouts in shared memory (part of the
  ABI).
- Memory is `SharedArrayBuffer`-backed (needed anyway for asset `AudioData` delivery and
  main↔worklet comms).

## AudioData (samples) delivery — SAB-backed engine memory

**Constraint:** a wasm module can address **only its own linear memory**. Unlike the TS worklet
(which can view any `SharedArrayBuffer` handed to it), the engine wasm cannot read an external SAB.
So sample PCM must live **inside** the engine's memory.

**Decision:** the engine's `WebAssembly.Memory` is created **`shared: true` + `maximum`** so its
`.buffer` *is* a `SharedArrayBuffer`. Then it mirrors the TS sample path zero-copy: PCM lives in the
shared memory; the main thread/loader writes it; the engine reads it as `&[f32]` in render — no copy,
no JS in the hot path. (Needs COOP/COEP — already in place.)

Flow (the off-thread asset path of the execution-only model):
1. Main thread / loader fetches + decodes the sample to f32 PCM **off-thread**.
2. It writes the PCM into a host/engine-designated region of the shared memory.
3. The box-graph sample reference is "ready" only after the write completes (ready flag / pointer);
   the engine reads it **only then**.
4. Render reads the sample slice directly at its offset — zero-copy, identical principle to TS.

**Growth:** samples are large/dynamic and can't be pre-sized for all cases → `memory.grow` the
**shared** memory **off-thread** as samples import. Shared-memory grow does not detach the buffer
(existing views stay valid, length extends). **Never grow during `process`.**

**Current state:** the spikes used a **non-shared** `Memory`; supporting AudioData requires switching
the engine memory to `shared: true` + `maximum`. AudioData delivery is the concrete driver to make
the memory SAB-backed (was deferred above) and raises the stakes on the shadow-stack overlap below.

## Spike (do this first)

Tiny PoC in an AudioWorklet: engine wasm + 1 device wasm sharing one `Memory` + `Table`, render a
block **wasm-to-wasm**, measure. Validate model **A**; confirm **C** as fallback. This de-risks the
plugin architecture before any real porting.

## Device state must be per-instance (no module statics) — verified

A device module is loaded **once** but instantiated **many times** (10 reverbs, 20 EQs). Holding DSP
state in Rust `static mut` gives **one global per module** at a fixed linear-memory address, so every
"instance" shares it and corrupts the others. Proven: two instances of one `osc` module with their
own state → clean independent 110 + 440 Hz (parity 6e-8); the same two pointed at one shared state →
both tones collapse to garbage.

**Rule:** instance state lives in an **engine-assigned state block** in shared memory, handed to the
device via the descriptor (`process(desc)` where the descriptor carries a `state_ptr`). Devices are
**reentrant code over external state** — never module-global mutable state. (The `chain-lp` /
`chain-delay` spike devices use `static mut` and are therefore single-instance demos only.)

**Safe devices.** Crossing the raw-offset boundary needs `unsafe`, but it is confined to one audited
shim crate (`abi`): `Ports::from_descriptor(desc_ptr)` parses the canonical descriptor into safe
slices (`output: &mut [f32]`, `inputs.get(i): &[f32]`, `params: &[f32]`) and typed state
(`state: &mut S`). Device DSP is then **100% safe Rust** — the only `unsafe` a device contains is the
single boundary call. `osc` is the reference (verified bit-identical after the conversion).

## Shadow-stack overlap — found, UNSOLVED

The comprehensive rack (`comp-engine` + filter + ring + heap-delay, all in one shared memory)
confirmed data isolation works but surfaced a separate problem: **rust-lld pins every module's
shadow stack at `[0, stack-size)`**. `--global-base` relocates a module's *static data* (verified:
engine 1 MiB, filter 4 MiB, ring 8 MiB, delay heap 13 MiB — disjoint) but **not** the stack;
`--stack-first` had no effect via `rustc-cdylib-link-arg`. So all modules' shadow stacks overlap.

Today it's harmless only because the spike's DSP functions keep locals in wasm registers and never
spill to the linear-memory stack (full-rack parity is bit-exact). But a device that spills (large
local arrays, deep calls) would clobber the caller's live frame. Options to resolve before complex
devices land:

- **Per-device memory (model B/C):** each module its own memory for stack/heap, share only an I/O
  memory. Cleanest isolation; needs multi-memory or host-copied I/O.
- **No-spill discipline:** keep device DSP register-only (no large stack locals); enforce by lint /
  review. Fragile.
- **Patch `__stack_pointer`:** post-link rewrite of each module's stack-pointer global into its slab.
  Works but hacky.

Decision pending. Does not block the single-device path; matters for the multi-device rack.

## Open

- Multi-memory browser support (decides whether **B** is viable).
- Device allocator strategy (`no_std` / custom global allocator / arena API).
- Is per-device JS-copy (**C**) fast enough at scale? → spike measurement.
