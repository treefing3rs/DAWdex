# Open Issue Plans

One plan file per open GitHub issue (55 issues, snapshot 2026-07-08). Each file follows
`_TEMPLATE.md`: what is asked, current behaviour with real `path:line` references, a concrete
plan, and risks. Doability is rated 1 to 5 (5 = small and clear, 1 = major project needing
architecture work or maintainer decisions).

## Reading the tiers

**5 (4 issues)** ship in a sitting: #289, #91, #263 are near-mechanical, #234 is an evaluation.

**4 (17 issues)** are well-scoped fixes and features with the root cause or an exact template
already pinned. The bug cluster (#208, #274, #73, #79) and the contained device work (#149, #241,
#133, #85) live here.

**3 (14 issues)** are moderate: real new code or a UX decision, but a clear path. Several new
effects (#90, #195, #203, #211) and the interaction reworks (#88, #57, #58) sit here.

**2 (17 issues)** need an architecture or product decision before coding: new schema (#38), new
routing (#270), new device-graph containers (#288, #174), or a live repro (#291, #292). Note #170
and #245 already have their own dedicated plans in `plans/`.

**1 (3 issues)** are foundational projects. #139 and #141 both require a modulation/nested-device
system that does not exist yet, and #154 needs a full generator engine. These unlock many other
requests once built (a modulation layer would also serve #102, #149, #89).

## Cross-issue themes

- **Automation node interaction** (#274, #275, #208, #291, #292, #271, #38) is one subsystem. Fix
  #274 (grid snapping on create) first, then #275 builds on it.
- **Playfield generalization** (#85, #174, #288) is one arc: #85 is the tractable slice, #288 is
  the full refactor.
- **Time/pitch DSP** (#188, #201, #209) shares FFT and voice infrastructure and relates to the
  existing time-stretch v2 plan.
- **Modulation** (#139, #102, #149, #89, #270) all want a parameter-modulation layer. Building #139
  properly would subsume much of the rest.
