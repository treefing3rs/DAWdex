//! The note content of an audio unit, the adapter analog the sequencer reads each block (TS reads
//! `adapter.tracks.collection` -> note tracks -> regions / clips). The source visits each NOTE track
//! with an accessor exposing its timeline regions (range query) and its launched-clip content, so the
//! sequencer can split the block into clip sections per track (TS `clipSequencing.iterate`) and read
//! the right content per section. The engine implements this over the box-graph bindings.
