//! Transport over a 128-sample render quantum. `process_quantum` is the fixed-bpm fast path (one
//! block); `render_quantum` is the block loop: it splits the quantum at the nearest action — a
//! marker jump (the marker track's section repeats), the loop-area end, or a tempo-change grid
//! (where a `ValueEvent` bpm map changes the bpm). At a loop end or a marker jump it emits the
//! partial block, jumps the position back (loop start / section start), re-evaluates the bpm there
//! (the discontinuity), and keeps filling the quantum, so a wrap is sample-accurate with no gap.
//! Mirrors core-processors `BlockRenderer`, including its action precedence: markers are evaluated
//! first, the loop takes over only when strictly earlier, tempo only when strictly earlier than both.
