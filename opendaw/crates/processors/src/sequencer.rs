//! NoteSequencer, the Rust counterpart of core-processors `NoteSequencer` (focused on the timeline
//! path: a loopable note region backed by a `NoteEvent` collection). Per render block it emits
//! note-on / note-off lifecycle events at sample offsets. Notes whose start falls in the block begin
//! (one per loop cycle the block overlaps); notes retained from earlier blocks end when their span
//! completes, or immediately on a transport stop or position discontinuity (e.g. a loop wrap).
//!
//! Cross-block notes live in an `EventSpanRetainer`, keyed by a monotonic id so note-offs match their
//! note-on. Region looping is resolved with `locate_loops`; note positions are region-local and mapped
//! to the global timeline per cycle.
