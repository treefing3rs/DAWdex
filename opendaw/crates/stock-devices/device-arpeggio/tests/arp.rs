//! The arpeggiator core (`process`, driven by the device ABI's events): a held chord keeps arpeggiating
//! across blocks that carry NO new input (the active-note spans persist in state), the output is not
//! one-to-one (a few held notes become a stream of stepped on/off events), releasing the chord stops new
//! notes, and a transport jump releases everything held. Rate is 1/16 (240 pulses) with the default gate 1.0
//! (step length == rate), so each step's note-off comes due exactly one step later.
