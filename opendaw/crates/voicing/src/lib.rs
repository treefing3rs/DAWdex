//! Shareable polyphony for synth devices, a heap-free port of the TS `voicing` framework (Voice / Voicing /
//! strategies / unison). A synth implements the [`Voice`] trait (its per-note DSP); the framework owns the
//! FIXED voice storage in the device's (zeroed) state block and allocates / steals / frees by index, with no
//! `new` per note and no allocator. Const-generic over the polyphony so a device picks its voice/stack counts.
//!
//! Built over the one [`Voice`] trait: the two [`VoicingStrategy`] implementations, [`PolyphonicStrategy`] (a
//! fixed pool with free-slot / steal / glide-from-released) and [`MonophonicStrategy`] (one voice plus a
//! held-note stack with legato glide); [`VoiceUnison`] (N detuned/spread sub-voices played as one note, itself
//! a [`Voice`] so it nests into either strategy); and [`Voicing`], the runtime dispatcher that switches between
//! the two strategies by [`VoicingMode`].
