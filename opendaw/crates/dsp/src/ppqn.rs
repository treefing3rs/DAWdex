//! (seconds / samples / pulses) are f64 so positions stay sample-accurate over a long timeline;
//! the rate inputs (`bpm`, `sample_rate`) are f32 control values, promoted to f64 inside. Since
//! they are exactly representable in f32, results match the all-f64 math.
//!
//! This is the single home for PPQN: devices reach it through their `dsp` dependency, and the host's
