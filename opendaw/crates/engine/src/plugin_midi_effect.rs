//! The `PluginMidiEffect` bridge: a MIDI-effect device's host-side identity.
//!
//! Unlike `PluginInstrument` / `PluginAudioEffect`, a MIDI fx is NOT an audio-graph `Processor` node — it
//! produces no audio and is never scheduled. It is a lazily-PULLED link in a unit's event pull chain
//! (`PullLink::MidiFx`): when something downstream pulls it for a pulse range, the host invokes the
//! device's `process_events` (passing its per-instance state), and the device pulls its OWN upstream (over
//! a range it chooses) and returns the transformed events. This type owns that identity — the device's
//! table slot, its instance state, and its bound parameters — and exposes the operations. The pull-chain
//! descend/restore that routes the device's own upstream pull (and swaps its params into the pull context)
//! lives in the engine's `host_pull_events`, not here.
