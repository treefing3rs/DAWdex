//! The sample resource (Route F): decoded audio frames resident in the engine's shared linear memory, keyed
//! by the `AudioFileBox` uuid and addressed by a `u32` handle. The handshake (driven by the worklet + the
//! main-thread loader, wired separately) is: the engine REQUESTS a sample on seeing the box, the loader
//! fetches + decodes it and reports the byte length, the engine ALLOCATES exactly that and hands back the
//! pointer, the loader writes the PLANAR f32 frames there, and the engine marks the slot READY.
//!
//! A device resolves a handle to a [`SampleRef`] (frames pointer + frame/channel count + sample rate) each
//! block; an unready handle resolves to `None` and the device skips it. Frames are PLANAR: channel `c` lives
//! at `frames_ptr + c * frame_count * 4`. The PCM storage is talc-owned and kept alive in the slot, so the
//! pointer is stable until the sample is freed (its box removed).
