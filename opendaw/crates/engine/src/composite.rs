//! Composite devices: a device box that, instead of being a single leaf DSP, HOSTS a child collection of its
//! own instruments (e.g. Playfield's sample slots), each with its own chains, summed into one output. This is
//! the engine-side, GENERIC mechanism — it learns a composite only as a registered `CompositeSpec` (its child
//! collection's host field + index key); no box name or field key is hardcoded here. Playfield is just one
//! registration.
//!
//! A composite is built recursively: `build_one_child` realizes each child by its OWN box type — a direct
//! instrument slot becomes an edge-only `SlotCluster` (reconciled in place, like a leaf unit), a cell becomes a
//! wholesale cluster (`build_cluster`), and a nested composite recurses through `build_composite`. So a composite
//! may contain composites, with no special case.
//!
//! The `CompositeBinding` is the PERSISTENT per-child cascade the owning unit keeps: the child-collection
//! observation plus one record per child (its processors, fx-chain observations, choke set, nested cascade).
//! A child add / remove / reorder is reconciled PER CHILD (`reconcile_composite_children`) — only the joiner is
//! built, only the leaver torn down, survivors keep their voices — exactly like the leaf `AudioDeviceChain`,
//! one level down.
