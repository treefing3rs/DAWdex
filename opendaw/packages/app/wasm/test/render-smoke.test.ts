// End-to-end AUDIO smoke test: build the whole project on the real engine + device modules, press play, and
// assert the master output is actually AUDIBLE. Every other engine test asserts box-graph checksums or
// processor identity — none asserts that sound comes out. This catches "the whole engine went silent"
// regressions (a broken master wiring, a summing bug, a stuck/zeroed bus) that checksums cannot see.
