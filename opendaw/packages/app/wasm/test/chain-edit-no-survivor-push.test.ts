// The contract (your words): changing a plugin's index, OR adding / removing a plugin, must do NOTHING to the
// EXISTING plugins — no rebuild and no parameter re-push (a re-push glides e.g. the delay's offset). This
// drives the real engine + devices and toggles a plugin's chain membership (add <-> remove), asserting that a
// REMOVE pushes zero parameters and an ADD pushes a small, CONSTANT count (only the joiner's own), never
// scaling with / re-touching the survivors.
