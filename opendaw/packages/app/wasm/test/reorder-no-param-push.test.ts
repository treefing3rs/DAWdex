// The reported hiccup: toggling the delay/gate REORDER (the last transaction) makes the delay glide its
// offset. A reorder must touch NOTHING on existing plugins — no rebuild AND no parameter re-push (a re-push
// re-sets the delay time, and its `set_offset` glides). This drives the real engine + devices through the
// actual reorder while RENDERING, and asserts neither device_build_count nor param_push_count moves.
